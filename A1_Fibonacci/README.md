## Assignment A1

Title : Recursive an Iterative algorithms

Objectives: 
 
• Learn to implement procedures and to pass parameters. 
• Understand how to use recursion to define concepts. 
• Learn to implement recursive functions and handle a stack using low level instructions. 
• Learn how to write iterative program 
• Analyze algorithm in tern of time and space Complexity

Aim: Write recursive & iterative programme which computes the nth Fibonacci number, for appropriate values of n. 
Analyze behavior of the programme in their time and space complexity.
